Log on to ec2 as ubuntu and execute the find command to search for all files in the /etc directory structure that have been modified in the past 10 days.

Solution:
find /etc -mtime -10 -ls
find /etc -mtime +10 -ls   --finds files modification date is older than 10 days



2) Log on to ec2 as ubuntu and create one file and one directory in the home directory. List the file and directory and observe the permissions, ownership, and owning group. Try to move the file and directory to the /var/log directory and observe the output. Try again to move them to the /tmp directory. Duplicate the file with the cp command and then rename the duplicated file using any name. Finally, remove the file and directory created for this lab.

Solution:
touch testfile
mkdir testdir
ls -l
sudo mv /home/ubuntu/testdir /var/log/testdir
sudo mv /home/ubuntu/testfile /var/log/testfile
sudo mv /var/log/testfile /tmp/testfile
sudo mv /var/log/testdir /tmp/testdir
cp testfile testfilever2
cp -r testdir testdirver
rm -r testdirver2
rm -r testdir
rm testfile
rm testfilever2





3) Log on to ec2 as ubuntu and execute the find command to search for regular files in the /etc directory structure that were accessed more than 10 days ago, are not bigger than 5MB in size, and are owned by the user root.

4) Log on to ec2 as ubuntu and create file file11 and directory dir11 in the user’s home directory. Make a note of the
permissions on them. Run the umask command to determine the current umask. Change the umask value to 0035 using the symbolic notation and then create file22 and directory dir22 in the user’s home directory. Observe the permissions on file22 and dir22 and compare them with the permissions on file11 and dir11. Using the chmod command, modify the permissions on file11 to match that on file22. Using the chmod command, modify the permissions on dir22 to match that on dir11. Do not remove file11, file22, dir11, and dir22 yet.
 
5) Log on to ec2 as ubunut and create directory /shared_dir1. Create a group called shared_grp and assign user1000 and user2000 to it (create these users if they do not already exist). Set up appropriate ownership, group membership, and permissions on the directory to support group collaboration.
